This GitHub repository documents my journey specializing in back-end development through the Alx specialization program. This 3-month program is available to those who have successfully completed the 9-month foundation stage and focuses on the user's chosen niche, which includes options for front-end and back-end development. In my case, I have chosen to specialize in back-end development, and this repository serves as a comprehensive guide to all the courses and concepts I have learned during this 3-month journey.
