					ES6 CLASSES
	Classes in JavaScript are a relatively new addition to the language, introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). They are a way to define a blueprint for creating objects that share common properties and methods.

In JavaScript, classes are defined using the class keyword, which includes a constructor method that is called when an instance of the class is created. This constructor method allows you to define the initial state of the object, which can include instance variables and properties.

Classes can also include other methods, which are defined within the class definition using the normal function syntax. These methods can be used to perform various operations on the object, such as setting or getting the value of properties or manipulating the object's state.

One important feature of classes in JavaScript is that they support inheritance, which allows you to create a new class based on an existing class. This can be done using the extends keyword to create a subclass that inherits all of the properties and methods of the parent class, while also adding new ones or overriding existing ones.

Overall, classes in JavaScript provide a convenient and powerful way to define and work with objects in the language, and they are increasingly being used in modern JavaScript development.
