			ES6 Promises

Promises are a powerful and fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow for more efficient and readable asynchronous programming.
In simple terms, a promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
 and allows you to define what happens when that operation completes.
