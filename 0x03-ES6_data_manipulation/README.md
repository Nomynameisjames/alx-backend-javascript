							ES6 Data Manipulation

ES6 (ECMAScript 6) is a new version of the popular programming language JavaScript.
 One of the key features of ES6 is improved data manipulation capabilities. In this README, we will explore some of these features.

			This guide will cover three important topics in ES6 data manipulation:

How to use map, filter, and reduce on arrays.
Typed arrays.
The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures.
Using Map, Filter, and Reduce on Arrays
Map, filter, and reduce are methods used to manipulate data in an array.

Map - The map method is used to create a new array from an existing array by applying a function to each element in the original array. The new array will have the same number of elements as the original array, but with the function applied to each element.

Example:

		const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

		const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);

		console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Filter - The filter method is used to create a new array from an existing array by filtering out elements based on a condition. The new array will only contain elements that meet the specified condition.

Example:
		const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

		const sumOfNumbers = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);

		console.log(sumOfNumbers); // Output: 15

Typed Arrays
ES6 introduced typed arrays that allow you to work with arrays of a specific data type. Typed arrays are used to store binary data and are more efficient than traditional arrays.

Example:
		const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);
		const int32View = new Int32Array(buffer);

		int32View[0] = 42;
		int32View[1] = 43;

		console.log(int32View); // Output: [42, 43]

Set, Map, and Weak Link Data Structures
ES6 introduced three new data structures - Set, Map, and WeakLink - that make data manipulation more efficient.

Set - The Set data structure is used to store unique values of any type. The Set is iterable and has methods for adding, deleting, and checking the existence of elements.

Example:
		const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4]);

		mySet.add(5);
		mySet.delete(4);
		console.log(mySet.has(2)); // Output: true

Map - The Map data structure is used to store key-value pairs of any type. The Map is iterable and has methods for adding, deleting, and checking the existence of elements.

Example:
		const myMap = new Map();

		myMap.set('firstName', 'John');
		myMap.set('lastName', 'Doe');

		console.log(myMap.get('firstName')); // Output: John
